But sometimes I just want to send a fucking message, not 'make a TODO.' Boom, I just 'broke' the new email.\n\n_Email works because it does nothing but messaging._",

It’s critical that they’re visible.\n\nSo I rely on the [Multiple Inboxes feature](https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/gmail/choose-inbox-type/#!/section-4) in Gmail to ensure that three key folders are in view:\n\n* Follow Up\n\n* Waiting\n\n* Read Through.\n\nMultiple Inboxes has been around for a while in Gmail, but only recently graduated from the experimental Labs area. You can enable it from the Advanced tab under Settings.",
